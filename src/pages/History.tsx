                The Civil Hospital, Hyderabad, also known as Liaquat University Hospital (LUH), is a 2200-bed 
                tertiary care hospital in Hyderabad, Sindh. With a rich history spanning over a century, it has 
                been a cornerstone of healthcare in the region.
              </p>
              <p>
                The hospital was initially established in 1881 to provide basic health facilities to the people 
                of Hyderabad and surrounding areas. This marked the beginning of organized medical care in the region, 
                serving as a vital resource for the growing population.
              </p>
              <p>
                The hospital's construction was completed with seven wards by 1894 at a cost of 88,173 rupeesâ€”a 
                significant investment at the time. These initial wards laid the foundation for what would become 
                one of the largest healthcare institutions in Sindh.

                  center for medical education and training.

                  new campus in Jamshoro. This transition further strengthened the region's medical education 
                  infrastructure and research capabilities.
